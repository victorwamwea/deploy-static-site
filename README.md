## What is Amazon S3?
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

## Benefits of S3
- Durable: The services provided allow your app to scale without fluctuating downtime.
- Highly available: It is available across so many data regions worldwide.
## Deploying a static website
 There are several ways to host your website:
 - Using the S3 console
 - Using the AWS software development kit
 - Using the AWS command line interface
   
We will use the S3 console to deploy and host a website in this project.

# Step 1
 ### Create a bucket
A bucket is a container for objects. To store your data in Amazon S3, you first create a bucket and specify a bucket name and AWS Region. Then, you upload your data to that bucket as objects in Amazon S3.
